# Icons & assets

AWTRIX ships with an empty `/ICONS` directory. This page is about filling it: getting an
8×8 image in there, giving it a name, and putting that name in a payload.

## Install from the AWTRIX Hub

Open **Icons → Add → Open icon gallery** in the built-in web UI, or go directly to the
[AWTRIX Hub](https://awtrix.de/icons). Search the community collection, open an icon and choose
**Send to your AWTRIX**. Your browser downloads the original and transfers it directly to the
display on your local network. AWTRIX itself never contacts the internet.

Downloading an original requires signing in to the Hub. Reloading an installed Hub icon,
publishing and automatic [`# @icons`](scripting.md#the-icons-your-script-needs) installation also
use a Hub connection key. Create one in [your Hub account](https://awtrix.de/account/settings) and
paste it into **System → AWTRIX Hub**. The key stays in this browser and is not stored on AWTRIX.

Installed Hub icons are marked in the device gallery and offer **Reload from Hub** to fetch an
author's update under the same name. Use that name in a payload or in a script's `# @icons` line.

### Contribute an icon back

Every icon on the clock offers **Publish to Hub** in its tile menu, and the
[Icon editor](icon-editor.md) can publish the current drawing. Both send
the icon to the shared collection with a display name you choose.

Publishing needs an **AWTRIX Hub** account, and the sign-in lives on the Hub rather than on your
clock. Save the connection key under **System → AWTRIX Hub**. The upload is
checked first - it has to be a GIF no larger than 32×8 and under 64 KB - and refused right away if
the exact same image is already in the collection, naming the icon that holds it. What passes is
published immediately; there is no review queue, and anything that should not be there is taken
down afterwards.

## Upload an icon

Two commands: upload the file, then use it.

```bash
# 1. upload an 8x8 JPEG. The file name becomes the icon ID.
curl -X POST "http://<awtrix-ip>/api/v1/files?dir=/ICONS" \
  -F "file=@1234.jpg"

# 2. use it
curl -X POST http://<awtrix-ip>/api/v1/notifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Mail","icon":"1234"}'
```
<!-- shot:begin id=mail-1234 hash=1c3a8760 -->
![The panel showing "Mail", an icon on the left](../assets/shots/icons/mail-1234.png){ .shot }
<!-- shot:end -->


The icon ID is **the file name without the extension**. `1234.jpg` on disk is `"icon":"1234"`
in a payload - never `"1234.jpg"`, never a path. IDs are matched literally and are
case-sensitive, so `Mail.jpg` is `"Mail"`.

The `?dir=` query parameter defaults to `/ICONS`, so it can be omitted for icons - spell it out
when you upload to `/MELODIES` or `/PALETTES`. The multipart **field name is irrelevant**
(`-F "file=@…"`, `-F "whatever=@…"` - both work); only the file name matters.

The built-in web UI at `http://<awtrix-ip>/` has a file manager for `/ICONS`, `/MELODIES` and
`/PALETTES` that drives the same endpoint, if you would rather drag and drop. It takes PNG and JPG
too and turns them into a GIF for you, so `mail.png` lands as `mail.gif`. Its **Icon Editor**
tab can also draw an 8×8 or 32×8 icon from scratch (or edit an existing one) and save it straight to
`/ICONS` - see [Icon editor](icon-editor.md).

Every upload is checked against the format its target folder expects: a GIF or JPEG for `/ICONS`,
valid RTTTL for `/MELODIES`, printable text for `/PALETTES`. A mismatch is rejected with
`415 unsupportedMediaType` and the partial file is removed. A failed write - a full filesystem,
usually - answers `500 internalError` rather than a false success. There is no size limit, and
the check cannot catch a well-formed but visually broken icon.

## Icon formats

Two formats are decodable, and an ID is resolved by trying both extensions in order:

| Tried | Path | Format |
|---|---|---|
| 1st | `/ICONS/<id>.gif` | animated GIF |
| 2nd | `/ICONS/<id>.jpg` | static JPEG |

**GIF wins.** `<id>.gif` is always tried first, and `<id>.jpg` only if that fails, so `mail.gif`
and `mail.jpg` cannot coexist under the ID `mail` - the JPEG becomes unreachable.

Uploading a PNG straight to the API is refused with `415 unsupportedMediaType`, and renaming it to
`.jpg` does not help - the check looks inside the file. Convert it to GIF first, or drop it into the
web UI, which does that for you.

**Use GIF.** At icon sizes a JPEG comes out both blurry and larger, so GIF is the better format for
anything you make yourself; `.jpg` is there for icons that already exist.

### Size

Make JPEG icons 8×8. A GIF keeps its own size up to the **active panel's width and height**, so
a 41×8 GIF plays at full size on a 41×8 panel. In the `icon` field, a GIF as wide as the panel
is drawn as a background behind the text. The same size limits apply to script icons, pushed
apps and notifications.

Keep every animation frame within the panel's width and height. Resize oversized GIFs before
uploading. If an image does not load, try a smaller or shorter GIF. See [Limits](../reference/limits.md#display)
for supported panel sizes.

### GIF playback

| Behaviour | Detail |
|---|---|
| Looping | Infinite; the loop count in the file is ignored |
| Frame delay | Each GIF uses its own frame timings. A delay of `0` becomes **100 ms** |
| Colors | Each GIF uses its own colors, including when several GIFs appear together |
| Transparency | Transparent pixels keep whatever the previous frame drew there |

## Use an icon in a payload

The `icon` key is accepted by notifications and pushed apps alike:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://<awtrix-ip>/api/v1/apps/pushed/news \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Long headline that scrolls","icon":"1234","iconMode":"push"}'
```
<!-- shot:begin id=long-headline-that-scrolls-1234 hash=7a4ca93d -->
![The panel showing "Long headline that scrolls", an icon on the left](../assets/shots/icons/long-headline-that-scrolls-1234.gif){ .shot }
<!-- shot:end -->


To show several images at once, use the optional `icons` array with `{icon, x, y}` objects.
Up to four additional icons animate independently at the positions you choose:

```json
{
  "icons": [
    {"icon": "weather", "x": 0, "y": 0},
    {"icon": "mail", "x": 16, "y": 0}
  ]
}
```

You can also use the `icon` field in the same payload. See [Multiple icons](../reference/payload.md#multiple-icons)
for drawing order and limits.

Everything about how an icon renders and lays out - the `icon`, `iconMode`, `iconOffsetX` and
`iconGap` keys, the text column beside it, the full-width GIF background, and what happens when an icon is
missing or cannot be displayed - is covered in the
[payload reference → Icon](../reference/payload.md#icon).

## Inline base64 icons

You do not have to upload a file at all. The mode is chosen **purely by the length of the
`icon` string**:

* **64 characters or fewer** → a file ID, resolved as above.
* **more than 64 characters** → the string is decoded as base64 image data, then played as an
  animated GIF or decoded as a JPEG depending on what the bytes turn out to be.

```bash
curl -X POST http://<awtrix-ip>/api/v1/notifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"text\":\"Inline\",\"icon\":\"$(base64 -w0 1234.jpg)\"}"
```
<!-- shot:begin id=inline-icon hash=d8daa0d9 -->
![The panel showing "Inline", an icon on the left](../assets/shots/icons/inline-icon.png){ .shot }
<!-- shot:end -->


This suits a one-shot notification from a script that has the image to hand and does not want to
leave a file behind. The trade-off is payload size: the image travels with every request.

The threshold cuts both ways, so keep file names short. An icon ID longer than 64 characters is
treated as base64 data, fails to decode, and the page renders without an icon.

## List and delete

```bash
# what is on AWTRIX, and how full is it?
curl "http://<awtrix-ip>/api/v1/files?dir=/ICONS"
```

The response carries a `files` array of `{"name": …, "size": …}` entries plus `usedBytes` and
`totalBytes` for the whole partition. Listing a directory that does not exist returns `200` with
an empty `files` array, not a 404.

```bash
# remove one - note this takes a full path, not an ID
curl -X DELETE "http://<awtrix-ip>/api/v1/files?path=/ICONS/1234.jpg"
```

`DELETE` takes `?path=` (a full path) while `GET`/`POST` take `?dir=` (a directory).

Parameter tables and every status code:
[HTTP reference → Files](../reference/http.md#files).

## Where assets live

AWTRIX creates four directories at boot:

| Directory | Holds | Extension |
|---|---|---|
| `/ICONS` | icons | `.gif`, `.jpg` |
| `/MELODIES` | RTTTL melodies | `.txt` |
| `/PALETTES` | custom palettes | `.txt` |
| `/SCRIPTS` | Berry sources and their stores | `.ax`, `.json` |

```bash
# download an icon back off AWTRIX
curl http://<awtrix-ip>/ICONS/1234.jpg -o 1234.jpg
```

`/ICONS/`, `/MELODIES/` and `/PALETTES/` are served over `GET` in every mode. `/SCRIPTS/*` and
the app-order file `/apploop.json` are served outside provisioning AP mode only; a script's
source can also be read with
[`GET /api/v1/apps/script/{name}`](../reference/http.md#get-apiv1appsscriptname).
Authentication, when configured, applies to these routes like every other route.

Full route details, status codes and MIME mapping:
[HTTP reference → Web UI and static assets](../reference/http.md#web-ui-and-static-assets).

## Storage budget

Icons, melodies, palettes and Berry scripts share whatever flash AWTRIX leaves over. On a
4 MB ESP32 that is **512 KB**, which is tight: a few dozen 8×8 JPEGs, or
considerably fewer animated GIFs. Larger boards get more; see
[Limits → Storage](../reference/limits.md#storage).

`usedBytes` and `totalBytes` from `GET /api/v1/files` are the authoritative numbers, and the web
UI renders them as a storage bar. Nothing enforces the budget for you - an upload that does not
fit fails with `500 internalError` rather than being refused up front.

A [factory reset](../reference/system.md#persistence-and-resets) formats the filesystem and
destroys every asset. `POST /api/v1/settings/reset` does not.

## Security

The file API is confined to the asset folders. A multipart file name containing `..`, an absolute
path, or anything resolving outside `/ICONS`, `/MELODIES` or `/PALETTES` is rejected with
`400 invalidPath`, and read and delete are held to the same allowlist.

!!! warning "Authentication is off until you configure it"
    HTTP Basic auth applies to the file routes like every other route - including in
    provisioning AP mode, where uploads are refused outright with `403`. But no user name is
    configured by default, and until you set one the API is open to anyone who can reach
    AWTRIX. See [Authentication](../reference/http.md#authentication).
